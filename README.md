# DokiMods
A list of community made mods, all mods here are used for the mods manager. Or you can just download &amp; extract zips here to use with the Doki mod loader.

# Submit a mod
To submit a mod open an issue which includes a link to your mod's repository on github (code only, and must have assets/scripts in the repository hierarchy somewhere)
Then we will verify that your mod isn't malicious, build it and include a version ready to drag & drop in the DokiMods repository soon after.
